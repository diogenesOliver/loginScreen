This project will undergo some changes in its architecture

<h2> This is the home page </h2>
<p> This is the first image a non-logged-in customer sees when entering the site. </p>

<br>

<h2> Created a new user </h2>
<p> Next page when the customer creates a new user, for confirmation the customer must enter his data again. </p>

<br>

<br>

<br>

<h2> Portal user </h2>
<p> After this user enters his data and confirms his email and password, he will be redirected to this page, which would be more or less the simulation of a user portal. </p>
